  details: "The Ultimate DeepFake Detection System is a high-performance, multi-modal AI framework designed for accurate video authenticity verification. It combines advanced computer vision techniques with deep learning to analyze visual and temporal patterns in videos, effectively identifying synthetic manipulations. The system processes input videos from datasets like FaceForensics++, DFDC, Celeb-DF, and custom sources. Using RetinaFace, it extracts and aligns facial regions, followed by standardized cropping at 224×224 resolution. Multiple modalities are then analyzed: CLAHE enhancement for texture irregularities, edge detection (Canny + Sobel) for boundary consistency, and FFT transformation for frequency-domain artifacts. Each modality is processed through a dedicated CNN model that outputs probability scores, forming temporal sequences analyzed by a Bidirectional LSTM for final decision-making. This fusion model achieves 88.75% overall accuracy with a 96.16% AUC, significantly outperforming individual modality networks. Designed for interpretability and efficiency, the architecture supports real-time inference and confidence scoring, ensuring robustness across varied datasets and compression levels. The system’s modular design allows easy integration as a standalone application, research framework, or API service. Its innovation lies in multi-modal fusion, temporal consistency analysis, and confidence calibration, providing a reliable, interpretable, and scalable solution for modern video forensics. Through advanced CNN architectures, attention mechanisms, and optimized regularization strategies, the model minimizes overfitting while maximizing generalization, making it suitable for real-world deployment in detecting deepfakes generated by GANs, autoencoders, and commercial manipulation tools."

  details:"This project involves developing a machine learning model that suggests the most appropriate medicines based on a users symptoms, medical conditions, and personal health data. The system is trained on a large dataset of historical medical records, including information about symptoms, diagnoses, treatment protocols, and prescribed medications. By analyzing this data, the model identifies patterns and correlations, allowing it to recommend the best course of action for the user. The system allows users to input their symptoms and medical conditions through an intuitive web interface built with Flask, which then processes this input and generates tailored medicine recommendations. The model not only suggests the most appropriate medications but also provides dosage information, potential side effects, and possible drug interactions, ensuring a safer and more informed decision-making process. Key features of the system include personalized medicine recommendations based on symptoms and medical history, real-time updates as new medical knowledge becomes available, and alerts for potential drug interactions. The user-friendly interface allows for easy symptom entry, while the system remains scalable to support a broader range of conditions and treatments. Being data-driven, it relies on accurate machine learning algorithms to maintain reliability. The recommendation system leverages scikit-learn for training various models, and uses Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling. To ensure high accuracy, preprocessing steps like normalization and imputation are applied. The application also includes a feedback loop where healthcare professionals can evaluate suggestions, which helps refine future predictions. By integrating real-time medical data and maintaining adaptability, this solution supports faster diagnoses and reduces human error. The backend is secured, maintains patient confidentiality, and is designed for scalability in real-world clinical environments, making it a reliable asset for digital healthcare advancement.",
